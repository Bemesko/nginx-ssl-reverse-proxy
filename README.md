## Purpose

This repository contains my attempt to set up an NGINX reverse proxy with SSL enabled.

## Checklist
- [X] Deploy server and access application via HTTP
- [X] Generate a self-signed certificate
- [X] Access application via https://localhost

It worked!

## Notes

- 502 error on NGINX might mean that I'm trying to use HTTPS to host an application listening for HTTP

### Order of scripts for generating a self signed certificate:
1. `create_certificate_authority.sh`
2. `create_server_private_key.sh`
3. `generate_certificate_sign_request.sh`
4. `generate_certificate.sh`

### Key Terms
- SSL: Secure Sockets Layer
  - Allow encrypted communication between servers and clients
  - Deprecated for a while
  - People still refer to it for some reason
- TLS: Transport Layer Security
  - Does the same thing as SSL but it's the one currently used
- HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol
  - Most widely used protocol on the internet to exchange information
  - Things go from server to client as plain text
  - Insecure because any sensitive information can be intercepted and read as is
- HTTPS: HyperText Transfer Protocol **Secure**
  - Does the same thing as HTTP but encrypts data in a way that only the client and server can decrypt it
  - This encryption is made using TLS, in a nutshell both the client and server have keys they share to create an unique session key that is then used to encrypt and decrypt messages
- CN: Common Name
  - For static DNS, it is the IP address or hostname of a system that will use a certificate
- OpenSSL
  - Open source toolkit for SSL stuff such as generating certificates, validating them and converting them to various formats
- Self-Signed Certificate
  - A TLS certificate signed by its creator's personal or root CA certificate
- CA: Certificate Authority
  - Trusted organization that signs other people's certificates
  - If a certificate is signed by a trusted CA, it most likely belongs to the person it says it does
  - They have their own root certificate that is registered as a "parent" to other certificates they sign
  - To view trusted CAs in Microsoft Edge, go to `edge://settings/privacy` -> *Manage Certificates* -> *Certificate Authorities*
- Root Certificate
  - All certificates can either be root or have a chain of parents
  - Certificate authorities can be trusted by trusting their root certificate, which will propagate to all their children certificates
- .CRS: Certificate Signing Request
  - Generated by a site's owner with their private key
  - Given to a trusted certificate authority to sign a certificate
  - Has details about location, organization and FQDN
  - Starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----`
- FQDN: Fully Qualified Domain Name
  - Likely the full name of a website
- .CRT
  - File containing a signed certificate
  - Starts with `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----`
- .KEY
  - File containing a private key for either a CA or a server
  - If unencrypted, starts with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`
- X509
- RSA
- PEM
- PKCS#12 / P12
